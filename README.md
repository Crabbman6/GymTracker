![App Demo](https://i.imgur.com/pa82hj4.gif)



MinimalMuscle is a simple, no-nonsense fitness tracking app designed to help users keep track of their workouts. The app is built using the latest technologies and is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**
- **Android Jetpack Compose**
- **Android DataStore**
- **Coroutines**

## Features

- **Set Tracker**: Users can track their workout sets. The app allows users to increment their current set, reset the set count, and customize the total number of sets for a workout.
- **Timer**: The app includes a built-in timer that users can start, stop, and reset as needed during their workouts. This is on the same page as the Set Tracker for ease-of-access.
- **Notes**: Users can jot down notes about their workouts. This could include details about specific exercises, weights used, or general observations about the workout.

## Future Inclusions

The app is in active development, and I plan to add more features. Potential featueres could include: 

- **Exercise Library**: A library of common exercises and easy to understand guides. 
- **Workout History**: A history of past workouts, allowing users to track their progress over time.
- **Cloud Sync**: The ability to sync workout data across multiple devices.
